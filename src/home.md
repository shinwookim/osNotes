# Operating Systems
Nowadays, running a piece of computer software is as easy as double-clicking on a program's icon. We don't need to know anything about the underlying components of the physical computer to use it effectively. For instance, we can open Google Chrome without having to figure out the CPU's clock cycle; and we can print a document using Microsoft Word without worrying about the specific make and model of the printer.

This is all possible thanks to a software on the computer called an **operating system** that manages system resources (such as memory and peripheral hardware) while simultaneously hiding those details from user-level software.

This course examines the abstractions and interfaces that an Operating System provides to user-level programs. Specifically, we will explore how to efficiently allocate, share and manage the CPU, memory, persistent storage, I/O devices, and communications between competing processes.
