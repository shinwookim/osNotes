# Disks

DISKS...

disk-arm-seek (expensive operatoin) --> try to keep bits as contiguous

Using gemoetry to manage data

Longest linear section...is the outer most track....fastest and 

RAID - parallelism

mirroring....read speed. fine; write speed bad

parity - write the even or oddd
1 + 0 + 1 = 10 <- Even or ODd

If the computed parity doesnt match a stored parity...lost a 1
If it matches...lost a zero

Raid 4....N disks....1 for redunducy and N-1 capacity.

DISK REQUESTS.
SEEK TIME ... MOVING FROM TRACK TO TRACK (MOVING THE READ WRITE HEAD) IS SLOW

ROTATIONAL DELAY - MUST WAIT A REVOLUTION IF WE MISS
ACTUAL TRANSFER TIME - HOW MUCH TIME TO ACTUALLY READ THE DISK (EFFECITVIELY ZERO SINCE MODERN  HDD CONTROLLER HAS BIG RAMS)

spacial. locality

Seek Time, Rotational Delay fixed by manufacturing.

From software POV....decrease timne --> minimize seek distance
scheduling disk requests...batch scheduling
First Come First Served
...bad!. we should be able to service all jobs in (400).sweep to end to end

We can do better!
263 is the best-->go to the closest edge...go back
worst case...starting at the middle

Shortrest Job First...
not optimal in seek distance....we didnt go to the closer edge
but unfair...starvation (most of the data is on the outside edge...we will get stuck)

SCAN...does not matter on number of jobs
FCFS was bad beacuse it has zig-zags (lot of overlap)
SCAN reverses direction when we hit ground (causing unnesssary overlap)
LOOK reverses direction ...minimum !

CSCAN  - sweep the head as fast as possible ...worse seek distance, but faster
Only service jobs in one direction 'C' for circular
