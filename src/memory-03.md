# Virtual Memory
## Overlays

> Hand-written dynamic loading of subsets of a program's code and data

Programs need to be in RAM before running....can we run a program if we don't have enough space to fit?

If we have a address space....

*Can we extract a portion of code (`main()`) and put it in RAM?*
- Fit main() in ram, run it

Virtual Memory - Attempt to simulate more memory than exists on the system through automatic “overlays”
